# Welcome to Polygon Page!

Welcome to the most exciting and innovative platform to build your blockchain application on **Polygon Blockchain**. Blockchain technology is poised to revolutionise the way the digital world handles data and does business. Be a part of this revolution and get a head start with decentralised application development on Polygon.

This page will act as your guide into the **Polygon Ecosystem**. You'll find links to some useful resources and websites to get you up and started with building on Polygon in particular and Blockchain in general. Feel free to reach out to us on Telegram/Discord.

## **Developer Quick Start**

If you're an Ethereum Developer, you're already a Polygon developer.
All the tools you're familiar with are supported on Polygon out of the box: Truffle, Remix, Web3js.
Switch over to Polygon's RPC and get started!

Polygon's Test Network which is called **Mumbai** connects with **Ethereum's Go√´rli Testnet.**
All the network related details can be found in [network docs](/docs/develop/network-details/network)

- Setup [Metamask Wallet](/docs/develop/metamask/overview) or [Arkane Wallet](/docs/develop/wallets/arkane/intro)
- Deploy your Contracts on Polygon
    - [Using Alchemy](/docs/develop/alchemy)
    - [Using Chainstack](/docs/develop/chainstack)
    - [Using QuickNode](/docs/develop/quicknode)
    - [Using Remix](/docs/develop/remix)
    - [Using Truffle](/docs/develop/truffle)
    - [Using Hardhat](/docs/develop/hardhat)
    - [Using Replit](/docs/develop/replit)
- Connecting to Polygon [with RPC](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask) by adding Polygon on Metamask or directly via [Arkane](/docs/develop/wallets/arkane/network).

  Note that same RPC can be used with web3js.

    ```jsx
    // Javascript

    const Web3 = require('Web3')

    // Sign up for a free dedicated RPC URL at https://rpc.maticvigil.com/ or other hosted node providers.
    const web3 = new Web3('https://rpc-mumbai.matic.today')

    // web3 object is now connected with Polygon's node
        ```

### **ü¶ï Already have a dApp?**

- **Migrating from Ethereum chain (or any EVM based chain for that matter)**

    Deploy all your smart contracts directly on Polygon chain. You don't have to worry about the underlying architecture, as long as it is EVM compatible!

    [Deploying your dApp on Polygon](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/integrate/quickstart)

- **Using Polygon as a faster transactions layer**

    Using Polygon as a transactions layer in your DApp deployed on Mainnet, you can get started with getting your tokens mapped by us.

    Getting your tokens mapped on Polygon: üëãüèº Ping us on [http://bit.ly/matic-technical-group](http://bit.ly/matic-technical-group)
