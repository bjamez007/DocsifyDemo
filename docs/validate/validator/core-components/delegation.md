Delegation is the process for the network participants who do not run a full node. Instead, delegators secure the network by staking with validators. To stake with the validators, delegators pay a commission to the validator of their choice.

Delegators run their delegation transaction on the staking contract on the Ethereum mainnet.

The MATIC tokens get bonded with the next [checkpoint](/docs/validate/glossary#checkpoint-transaction) committed on the Ethereum mainnet. Delegators also have an option to opt out of the system whenever they want. Similar to validators, delegators have to wait for the unbonding period to end before withdrawing their stake.

Delegators also have an option to re-delegate their MATIC tokens with another validator. Rewards are accumulated at every checkpoint.
