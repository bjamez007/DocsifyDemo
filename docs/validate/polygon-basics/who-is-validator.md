â€‹A validator is a participant in the network who locks up tokens in the network and runs [validator](/docs/validate/glossary#validator) nodes to run and secure the network.

Validators in Polygon Network are selected via an on-chain auction process which happens at regular intervals. These selected validators participate as block producers and verifiers. Once a [checkpoint](/docs/validate/glossary#checkpoint-transaction) is validated by the participants, updates are made on the parent chain (the Ethereum mainnet) which releases rewards for validators depending on their stake in network.

Those who are interested in securing the network but are not running a full node can participate as [delegators](/docs/validate/glossary#delegator).
