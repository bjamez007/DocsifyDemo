Polygon is a scaling solution for public blockchains. Polygon PoS supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster and cheaper transactions.

## Validator and delegator roles

On the Polygon Network, you can be a validator or a delegator. See:

* [Who Is a Validator](/docs/validate/polygon-basics/who-is-validator)
* [Who Is a Delegator](/docs/validate/polygon-basics/who-is-delegator)

## Architecture

If your goal is to become a validator, it is essential that you understand the Polygon architecture.

See [Polygon Architecture](/docs/validate/validator/architecture).

### Components

To have a granular understanding of the Polygon architecture, see core components:

* [Heimdall](/docs/contribute/heimdall/overview)
* [Bor](/docs/contribute/bor/overview)
* [Contracts](/docs/contribute/contracts/stakingmanager)

#### Codebases
